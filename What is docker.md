# What is docker?

Docker is an open source platform or a tool that helps developers to package, bundle and share their applications in containers. It helps large teams
so that the same applications runs on their machines with the same app code and dependencies like node.js mongodb etc.

# Refined

Docker is an open-source platform that helps developers package, distribute, and run applications in containers. It ensures that applications run
consistently across different environments by bundling the app code and all its dependencies (e.g., Node.js, MongoDB, etc.) into a container.
This is especially useful for large teams, as it eliminates the "works on my machine" problem and ensures a consistent development and deployment
experience.
